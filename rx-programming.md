ajax 
-----
$.ajax() <- jQuery

$http() <- angular

"For example, imagine your Twitter feed would be a data stream in the same fashion that click events are. You can listen to that stream and react accordingly."

Asynchronous, in JavaScript means we can call a function and register a callback to be notified when results are available, so we can continue with execution and avoid the Web Page from being unresponsive. This is used for ajax calls, DOM-events, Promises, WebWorkers and WebSockets.
Data, raw information in the form of JavaScript data types as: Number, String, Objects (Arrays, Sets, Maps).
Streams, sequences of data made available over time. As an example, opposed to Arrays you donâ€™t need all the information to be present in order to start using them.
