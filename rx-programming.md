Problem: your UI hangs while you are fetching or calculating some data
Use: callbacks to become asynchronous

Problem: you don't want to get into callback hell
Solution: use promises
http://callbackhell.com/

Problem: you have too many inputs and outputs and hard to keep track of it
Solution: use asynchronous event streams (observables) and functional programming style
Solution: use push and pull pattern to define the inputs and outputs, and also functional style of programming 
to make it easier to understand and to test

Problems: you want to return the results not a function
Solution: use flatMap

Problem: you want to run two streams and get a single output
Solution: use merge

Problem: you want to convert a promise to an observable
Solution: use fromPromise in RxJs

* `reactive programming`
* `subscriber` / `subcribe`
* `publish`
* `observable` aka `observable sequence`
* `observer`
* `selector`
* `property`
* `function`
* `asynchronous`
* `error`
* `event`

* `marble diagram`
* `stream` - multiple streams can used as input to other streams
* `event stream`
* `promise` (see angular promise)  - fromPromise (convert a promise to observable)
A Promise is simply an Observable with one single emitted value. Rx streams go beyond promises by allowing many returned values.

ajax 
-----
$.ajax() <- jQuery

$http() <- angular

"For example, imagine your Twitter feed would be a data stream in the same fashion that click events are. You can listen to that stream and react accordingly."

Asynchronous, in JavaScript means we can call a function and register a callback to be notified when results are available, so we can continue with execution and avoid the Web Page from being unresponsive. This is used for ajax calls, DOM-events, Promises, WebWorkers and WebSockets.
Data, raw information in the form of JavaScript data types as: Number, String, Objects (Arrays, Sets, Maps).
Streams, sequences of data made available over time. As an example, opposed to Arrays you donâ€™t need all the information to be present in order to start using them.
